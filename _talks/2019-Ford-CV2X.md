Current communication tools are slow, not scalable, and traffic mobility and communication modeling are decoupled. There is an urgent need to develop a scalable and integrated (coupled) traffic and communication modeling tool. In this project, we addressed this urgent need.
We developed an integrated traffic and communication modeling tool that captures the mutual interactions of both systems. More specifically:
- We developed a scalable analytical communication model that captures the packet movement at the milli-second level.
- We coupled the communication and traffic simulation models in real-time to develop a fully-integrated dynamic modeling tool.
- The model coupling time step is dependent on the number of concurrent vehicles in the network

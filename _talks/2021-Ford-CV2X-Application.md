In this project, our objectives were:
- Develop a scalable analytical communication model that captures packet movement at the milli-second level.
- Couple the communication and traffic simulation models in real-time to develop a fully-integrated dynamic modeling tool
- Evaluate performance benefits of V2X applications in large-scale settings ahead of real-world deployment decisions , in varied configurations: (1) Varying traffic volume; (2) Varying CV market penetration levels; (3) Different road networks

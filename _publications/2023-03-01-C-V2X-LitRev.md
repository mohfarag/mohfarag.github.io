As communication technology is developing at a rapid pace, connected vehicles (CVs) can potentially enhance vehicle safety while reducing vehicle energy consumption and emissions via data sharing. This paper includes a review of existing literature on the safety, mobility, and environmental impacts of CV applications; gaps in current CV research; and recommended directions for future research. The results of this paper will help shape future research for CV applications to realize their full potential.

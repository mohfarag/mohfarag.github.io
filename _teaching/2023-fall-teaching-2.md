I am teaching a senior-level undergraduate course in the CS department in the Fall 2023 semester at the CS department in Virginia Tech. The course is a project-based teaching experience. Students form groups and pick a term-long project to solve a real world problem using all the CS concepts they have learned during their four years in the CS department.

My name is Mohamed Farag. I'm a research associate at the Center for Sustainable Mobility (CSM) at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI). I'm responsible for maintaining, developing, and enhancing the INTEGRATION traffic simulator to support running large-scale, connected, and intelligent traffic simulations. 

I had my Ph.D in Computer Science from Virginia Tech university, my Master of Science in Computer Science from the Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport in Egypt and my B.sc. in Computer Engineering from Alexandria University. My research interests include intelligent transportation systems, connected/automated vehicles applications using C-V2X, machine learning, large-scale data analysis, large-scale system analysis and design, big data, and information retrieval. My research focus has been in using and applying artificial intelligence and scalability methods in different domains. Recently, I've been working on developing scalable and intelligent traffic simulations. Before that, I worked on developing scalable and intelligent crises events web crawler.
